# Invisibility-Cloak-Using-Python-and-OpenCV
If you like Harry Potter and Sci-Fic than you would definitely like this project. In this project I have created Invisibility Cloak using Python and OpenCV. The cloth you are considering magical cloth should be red in color.

You will find this code/program simpler and easy to understand than any of the other code available on internet.
